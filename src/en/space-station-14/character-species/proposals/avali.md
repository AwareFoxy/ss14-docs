## Overview

Avali are a new species with distinct characteristics from standard humanoids. They are shorter than most characters (just over a meter tall) with a unique physiology and set of attributes. While inspired by the Avali lore, Avali are designed with significant mechanical adjustments to make them a balanced and accessible addition. You can find more information on their background and structure on [the official Avali wiki page](https://avali.fandom.com/wiki/The_Official_Avali_Wiki).

### Combat and Balance
- **Lower Health with Advantages**: Due to their small size, Avali have only 80% of standard human health. To balance this, they have a small natural evasion bonus, allowing them to avoid certain attacks, and increased movement speed.
- **Equipment Limitations**: Large-caliber weapons are hard to manage for Avali. Using these weapons results in a high spread and lower accuracy, balancing their combat capabilities with their agility.
-  **Decreased bloodloss**: Avali will have purple blood, this blood is denser than that of other races, Avali will have a decreased bloodloss of 15%.
